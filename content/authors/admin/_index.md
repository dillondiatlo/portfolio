I bridge the gap between science and creativity. By leveraging my 10+ years of creative advertising experience with my expertise in Python, SQL, Tableau, data analysis, data modeling and more, I deliver results-driven insights and compelling narratives.

I'd love to be part of an in-house team where I can grow; further refining and marrying my unique skill sets.

My latest project helps NYC taxi drivers optimize their revenue-per-trip. The result is a Streamlit app, integrated with a GradientBoostRegressor and OpenWeatherAPI, and deployed for real-time use: https://fareforecaster.streamlit.app/
